CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is structured using a set of rules that define how elements in an HTML document should be styled. Here's an overview of the key components and concepts in CSS structure:

1. Selectors:
   - Selectors are used to target specific HTML elements for styling.
   - They can be based on element names, classes, IDs, attributes, or combinations thereof.
   - Examples: `p`, `.classname`, `#idname`, `[attribute]`, `element.class`, `element#id`.

2. Declaration Blocks:
   - A declaration block consists of a selector followed by curly braces `{}`.
   - Inside the curly braces, you define the style properties and their values.
   - Multiple declarations can be included within a single declaration block.

3. Properties and Values:
   - Each declaration consists of a property name followed by a colon `:` and a value.
   - Properties define the specific style aspect you want to modify (e.g., color, font-size, margin).
   - Values specify the desired setting for the corresponding property.
   - Example: `color: blue;`, `font-size: 16px;`, `margin: 10px;`.

4. Cascading and Specificity:
   - CSS follows a cascading order, where styles can be inherited from parent elements to child elements.
   - When multiple styles are applied to the same element, the one with the highest specificity takes precedence.
   - Specificity is determined by the selector's weight (inline styles > IDs > classes/attributes > elements).

5. Box Model:
   - The box model is a fundamental concept in CSS that describes how elements are rendered.
   - Each element is treated as a box with content, padding, borders, and margins.
   - You can control the dimensions, spacing, and appearance of these boxes using CSS properties.

6. Layout and Positioning:
   - CSS provides various layout techniques, such as floats, flexbox, and grid, to control the positioning and arrangement of elements.
   - Properties like `display`, `position`, `float`, `flex`, and `grid` are used to define the layout behavior.

7. Responsive Design:
   - CSS supports responsive design techniques to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
   - Media queries allow you to apply different styles based on the viewport width or other device characteristics.
   - Relative units (e.g., percentages, `em`, `rem`) and flexible layouts are commonly used for responsive design.

8. Inheritance and Specificity:
   - CSS properties can be inherited from parent elements to child elements.
   - Specificity determines which styles take precedence when multiple styles are applied to the same element.
   - Inline styles have the highest specificity, followed by IDs, classes/attributes, and element selectors.

9. Comments:
   - Comments in CSS are used to add explanatory notes or temporarily disable certain styles.
   - Single-line comments start with `//`, and multi-line comments are enclosed between `/*` and `*/`.
