CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is structured using a set of rules that define the visual appearance and layout of HTML elements. Here's an overview of the key components and concepts in CSS structure:

1. Selectors:
   - Selectors are used to target specific HTML elements or groups of elements.
   - There are various types of selectors, such as element selectors (e.g., `p`, `div`), class selectors (e.g., `.classname`), ID selectors (e.g., `#idname`), attribute selectors (e.g., `[attribute]`), and more.
   - Selectors allow you to apply styles to specific elements based on their type, class, ID, or other attributes.

2. Properties and Values:
   - CSS properties define the specific visual aspects of an element, such as color, font size, padding, margin, etc.
   - Each property is followed by a colon (`:`) and a value that specifies the desired setting for that property.
   - For example, `color: blue;` sets the text color to blue, and `font-size: 16px;` sets the font size to 16 pixels.

3. Declaration Blocks:
   - A declaration block consists of a selector followed by a set of curly braces (`{}`).
   - Inside the curly braces, you define one or more property-value pairs, each ending with a semicolon (`;`).
   - Multiple declaration blocks can target the same selector, and the styles will be applied in the order they appear in the CSS file.

4. Cascading and Specificity:
   - CSS follows a cascading order, where styles defined later in the stylesheet or with higher specificity take precedence over earlier or less specific styles.
   - Specificity determines which styles are applied when multiple selectors target the same element. Inline styles have the highest specificity, followed by IDs, classes, and element selectors.

5. Inheritance:
   - Some CSS properties are inherited by default, meaning that child elements inherit the styles from their parent elements.
   - For example, if you set the `font-family` property on a parent element, its child elements will inherit that font unless explicitly overridden.

6. Box Model:
   - CSS uses the box model to determine the size and spacing of elements.
   - Each element is treated as a rectangular box with content, padding, borders, and margins.
   - The `box-sizing` property can be used to control whether the element's size includes padding and borders (`border-box`) or not (`content-box`).

7. Layout and Positioning:
   - CSS provides various layout and positioning techniques to control the placement of elements on a web page.
   - Some common layout techniques include using `display` properties (`block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, `flex`, `grid`), floats, and positioning (`relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`).

8. Media Queries and Responsive Design:
   - Media queries allow you to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device or viewport, such as screen width or height.
   - By using media queries, you can create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

9. External Stylesheets and CSS Preprocessors:
   - CSS can be written in a separate file with a `.css` extension and linked to an HTML document using the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section.
   - CSS preprocessors like Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) and Less extend the capabilities of CSS by adding features like variables, mixins, and nested rules.

This is a high-level overview of how CSS is structured. CSS provides a wide range of properties and techniques for styling and laying out web pages, and mastering CSS requires understanding these concepts and applying them effectively.
